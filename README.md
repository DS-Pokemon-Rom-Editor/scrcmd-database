# scrcmd-database
Json Database for Script Commands and Parameters used in DSPRE and potentially other software.

The JSONs contain scrcmd documentation, movement commands, operators and sounds (so far) for the gen4 Pokemon games (so far) which can and will be parsed into a google sheet automatically. The google sheet can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1WE6aCJeVbIMDfWYPykQEqLyBAZCDK8YlYFBD6hChiVA/edit?gid=1043082083#gid=1043082083)
